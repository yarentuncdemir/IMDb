# IMDb
 
Using the data I scraped from Imdb, I created several charts and used the LSA algorithm to analyze the relationship between the titles of the movies and the terms from the summaries of the movies.

Some of the libraries I used in the project:

-Pandas(It is used to manage and analyze data.)

-Numpy(It is used to work with multidimensional arrays and matrices and for mathematical operations.)

-Seaborn and Matplotlib(It is used to work with multidimensional arrays and matrices and for mathematical operations.)

-Plotly(Provides online scientific charts. It is a web-based visualization tool.)

-BeautifulSoup(Used for web scraping.)

-Nltk (It is a natural language processing library which stands for Natural Language Toolkit.)

-Sklearn(machine learning models)
